--- GPR Training and Cross-Validation Script Finished ---
Next steps: 
1. Analyze CV results from 'gpr_cv_results.csv': Check consistency, errors per object, learned kernels.
2. If training time per fold was too long with N_downsample_factor=2, try N_downsample_factor=3.
3. Hyperparameter Tuning: Based on results, you might adjust kernel choices, initial parameters, or bounds.
4. Final Model Training: Once satisfied, train a final GPR model on ALL development data.
5. Final Evaluation: Test this final model on your hold-out test set (processed runs 3 & 4).
