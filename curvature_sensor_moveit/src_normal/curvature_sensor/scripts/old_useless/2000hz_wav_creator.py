"""
WAV File Generator for Curvature Sensing Experiment.

This script generates a multi-tone WAV file containing sine waves at frequencies from 
200 Hz to 2000 Hz (in steps of 200 Hz). The generated file is used for playback during 
curvature sensing experiments to provide a consistent acoustic input signal.

    Generate a combined sine wave signal for the given list of frequencies.
