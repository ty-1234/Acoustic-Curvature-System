"""
Script to collect audio data and extract FFT features for curvature sensing.

This script records audio from the system's microphone, processes it using FFT to extract
frequency-domain features, and saves the results to a CSV file with curvature information.

MODIFIED to target frequencies from 100 Hz to 16,000 Hz and use an appropriate sample rate.

Summary of Commenting Enhancements:

1. **`check_microphone` function:**
   - Added more detail to the docstring about the `expected_sample_rate` parameter.
   - Clarified logging messages.
   - Added comments for `sd.wait()` and catching `PortAudioError`.

2. **`main` function:**
   - Clarified the purpose of `Fs` (Sample Rate).
   - Added more detailed comments for `L` (FFT window size), explaining frequency resolution and window duration.
   - Added more detailed comments for `step_size`, explaining hop duration.
   - Clarified the `buffer = deque(maxlen=L)` initialization and its behavior.

3. **`audio_callback` function:**
   - Expanded the docstring to better explain its role, parameters, and the sliding window mechanism.
   - Added comments clarifying that `indata` is (frames, channels) and we take `[:, 0]`.
   - Added comments explaining that processing happens when `len(buffer) == L`.
   - Clarified the purpose of popping `step_size` samples for the sliding window.

4. **Stream Handling in `main`:**
   - Added comments explaining that `blocksize=step_size` means the callback is invoked with that many new frames.
   - Added a comment explaining the `while is_running: time.sleep(0.1)` loop.
   - Ensured the `finally` block comments clearly state actions like stopping and closing the stream.

5. **General:**
   - Ensured consistent terminology (e.g., "frames" vs. "samples" where appropriate).
   - Added `exc_info=True` to error logs for more detailed tracebacks during debugging.
   - Improved formatting of some multi-line comments.

These changes should make the script's operation, particularly the audio processing pipeline, more transparent and easier to understand for future developers or maintainers.
